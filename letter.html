        <h1> Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
<p>
    Dear Eileen,<br>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br> 
    of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Starting dates</strong>
<p>
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br> 
    could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
<ul>
<li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
<li>semester: 15 January 2017</li> 
<li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
</ul>
Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>
<p></p>
You can find more information about <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/quincylarson">important university dates</a> on our website.
</p>

    <strong>Subjects of study</strong>
<p>
At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br>
somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br> 
the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
by are as follows, in order of priority:
<ol>
<li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the<br> 
    audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</li>
<li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br>
    research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
</p>

<strong>Exotic dance moves</strong>
<p>
Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
<p></p>
<dl>
    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
<dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around</dd>
<dd>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt>brownian shuffle</dt> 
<dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which</dd>
<dd>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly</dd>
<dd>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired</dd> 
<dd>modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have</dd> 
<dd>discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants</dd> 
<dd>of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this</dd> 
<dd>because they were really cold.</dd>
</dl>
<p></p>
For more of my research, see my <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Marking_up_a_letter" >exotic dance research page.</a>
<p></p>
Yours sincerely,
<p></p>
Dr Eleanor Gaye
